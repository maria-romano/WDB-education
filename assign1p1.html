      H.E.R. (pronounced "her", an initialism for "Having Everything Revealed"),
      is an American R&B singer. After initial music appearances and singles

    <h3>Musical Career</h3>
    <p>
      Gabriella Sarmiento Wilson[1][2] was born in Vallejo, California[3] to a
      Filipina American mother and an African American father and raised in
      California's San Francisco Bay Area. As a 10-year-old performing as Gabi
      Wilson, she played an Alicia Keys song on the piano for the Today Show[1]
      and at the famed Apollo Theater in NYC on September 23, 2007, covering
      Aretha Franklin's "Freeway Of Love".[4][5] She made her acting debut at
      the age of 9, starring in the Nickelodeon television film School Gyrls.[6]
      She also performed on Maury in 2007, Good Morning America, and The View in
      2008.[6] At this time, she was managed by Will Smith's Overbrook
      Entertainment.[6] She performed at the 2010 BET Awards covering Keys'
      "Fallin'", sung a tribute to Keys at the ASCAP Awards, and competed on
      Radio Disney's The Next BIG Thing at age 12, with her song "My Music"
      featured on Radio Disney.[6] In 2011, at age 14, Wilson signed a record
      deal with Sony's RCA Records via J Records, in a deal arranged by her
      manager Jeff Robinson's MBK Entertainment. Her debut single "Something to
      Prove" was released under her real name.[6][7] Re-emerging in late 2016
      with a new persona, Wilson released her debut EP, H.E.R. Vol. 1 on
      September 9, 2016, produced by songwriter David "Swagg R'Celious" Harris.
      She received support from Usher, Tyrese, Pusha T, and Wyclef Jean;
      labelmates Alicia Keys and Bryson Tiller helped get the word out through
      Twitter co-signs, shoutouts, and re-posts.[8][9] In April 2017, Barbadian
      singer Rihanna posted an Instagram clip with H.E.R.'s track "Focus"
      playing in the background. The clip has been viewed over 5 million
      times.[10] Additional industry support came from Issa Rae of HBO's
      Insecure, Taraji P. Henson of Empire, Kylie Jenner, and Kendall
      Jenner.[citation needed] NPR listed H.E.R. Vol. 1 as the first selection
      in its "5 Essential R&B Albums You Slept On".[11] Calling the music
      "Slow-burning R&B that zooms in on emotional highs and lows," Rolling
      Stone included H.E.R. in its March 2017 "10 Artists You Need To Know"
      roundup.[12] Forbes named her one of "5 Alternative R&B Artists to Look
      Out for in 2017", reporting: "In the same vein as The Weeknd's enigmatic
      introduction to the world, H.E.R.'s image remains a mystery. The irony,
      though, is that her moniker is an acronym for Having Everything
      Revealed."[13] Wilson's follow-up EP, H.E.R. Vol. 2 (2017) also produced
      by Harris, was released on June 16, 2017, and includes the single "Say It
      Again". She went on tour with Bryson Tiller for the Set It Off tour, and
      concluded her first headlining tour, the Lights On Tour, in support of
      H.E.R. Vol. 2.[14] She released H.E.R. Vol. 2, The B Sides (2017),
      produced by Harris, on October 20, 2017, and the single "2" on October 13,
      2017. The compilation album H.E.R. was released on October 20, 2017,
      comprising the songs from each of the three EP's in this series. The album
      won Best R&B Album and received four other nominations at the 61st Grammy
      Awards, including Album of the Year and Best New Artist.[15]
